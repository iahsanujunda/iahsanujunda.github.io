<!-- Greeting -->
# Greetings, I'm Junda! 👋

<!--Introduction -->
I'm a **Senior Data Scientist** at [Rakuten](https://global.rakuten.com/corp/innovation/technology/), a leading e-commerce platform in Japan with global presence. Outside of work, I run freelance web development projects.

- 📚 I’m currently learning causal inference extensively for work
- 🐝 I have worked on several side projects on a web development using MERN stack that is deployed to Heroku
- 🔭 My wife is very obsessed about zero waste household, so I'm trying to help her by developing a device with a little bit of deep-learning-on-edge capability for waste management. I mainly use [intel OpenVINO toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/openvino-toolkit.html) with models built on pytorch
- 🌱 I'm adept at using alibaba cloud and GCP courtesy to professional experiences.
- 🍰 Fun fact: Me and my wife is a surprisingly good baker, a hobby that we both picked up due to COVID-19 quarantines
