This is the accompanying repository of [iahsanujunda.github.io](https://iahsanujunda.github.io), a personal blog powered by [hexo](https://www.hexo.io). Hexo is a light-weight blogging engine that only depends on parsing text files.

## Features

- Markdown parsing üåê
- Tags and Categories #Ô∏è‚É£
- Customizable themes ‚öôÔ∏è
- Blazing fast loading ‚ö°

## Setup

First, clone this repository to the local machine. Once the repo is cloned, install all dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iahsanujunda/iahsanujunda.github.io.git
cd iahsanujunda.github.io
npm install
```

From here, we can just run the site locally using hexo.

```bash
hexo server
```

## Writing New Post

Create new post simply by running the following command,

```bash
hexo new <title>
```

The new post will be generated by hexo as `source/_posts/<title>.md`, and we can start writing inside this file. For convenience sake, create a new branch outside of `hexo-source` and `master` when creating a new post, it will let us avoid a lot of pain down the line. Once the post is finished, merge the branch back to `hexo-source` to be published. 

## Deploying

Once a new post is finished, merge the new post branch into `hexo-source` branch. From here, we need to build a production site. There are two ways we can proceed with building the production site, either [(1)](https://github.com/iahsanujunda/iahsanujunda.github.io#1-manual-build) build the hexo site locally and push this build package, or [(2)](https://github.com/iahsanujunda/iahsanujunda.github.io#2-ci-build) leverage ci tools such as travis-ci to do the building, and put the built package to the hosting service. For github pages, second option is more recommended.

### 1. Manual Build

To build locally, run the following command.

```bash
hexo generate
```

The resulting build site will be put in `public/` directory. If we have specified deployment option beforehand, we can do one line deployment after buiding production site. Several options supported by hexo includes github pages, heroku, netlify, and rsync. [Read here](https://hexo.io/docs/one-command-deployment) to learn more about one-line deployment.

Running one-line deployment is as simple as,

```bash
hexo deploy
``` 

We can also deploy the content of `public/` directory manually to any hosting service of our choice.

### 2. CI Build

Using CI tools, we simply do `git push -u origin hexo-source` to the remote repository. If we have configured CI tools to integrate with this repository, it will build the hexo site and deployed it to specified hosting service. For this site, we have specified github pages as the hosting service according to [this guide](https://hexo.io/docs/github-pages) from hexo. Github pages need master branch to host the site, so if we want to host the codes and site at the same repo, we need to make use of another branch as default branch, in this case we use `hexo-source`. We can, of course, manually manage both `master` and `hexo-source` and push only appropriate content to each, but it is easy to make mistake in overwriting branches, so we offload this risk to the CI tools.
